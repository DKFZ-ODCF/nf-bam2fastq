# This file is needed for the conversion of the Docker image into a Singularity image that
# can be executed with `singularity exec`, like Nextflow does it. `singularity exec` does *not*
# invoke the runscript, but the environment initialization in the Dockerfile is done via the
# ENTRYPOINT and that is converted into the Singularity runscript.
#
# Note that the docker-daemon bootstrap allows to do this with locally tagged images.
